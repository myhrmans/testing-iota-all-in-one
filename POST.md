# IOTA in a Nutshell

&nbsp;

**IOTA** is a *free* and *scaleable* transaction settlement and data transfer layer for the Internet of Things (IoT). It is based on a novel distributed ledger technology, the **Tangle**, which overcomes the inefficiencies of current Blockchain designs and introduces a new way of reaching consensus in a decentralized peer-to-peer system.

... and [this](http://tangle.glumb.de/) is how it looks!
